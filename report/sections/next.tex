\chapter{What's next?}

In the upcoming trimester, I would like to look into the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Designing removal algorithms for both DiskANN and HNSW
    \item Implement all the algorithms
    \item Benchmark them
    \item Pick the best ones and parallelize them
    \item Benchmark them again
\end{enumerate}
